TODO Now:
Social Media Buttons
Meta tag component - implemented on home page, seems to be working
Find nice 900x300 image for posts
update sitemaps




TODO Later:
1) Validate Blog Search (see ngif that the pager is using)
2) Research why certain characters like # crash web api
4) Maybe a back button at bottom of post
* See if you can get the links to move you up to top elegantly
*Possible timer like dachecache to refresh memory
